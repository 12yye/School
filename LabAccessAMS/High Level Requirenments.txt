Database
	The system MUST maintain a record of all sign-in and sign-out events for each user, storing the data for a minimum of five (5) years.
	The database MUST allow queries that filter access records by student ID, date, and specific time intervals.
	The system MAY use a relational database (such as SQLite) to store student IDs, sign-in times, and sign-out times.
	The system MUST ensure that the student ID is unique in the database and linked to the appropriate sign-in/sign-out logs.

User Interface (UI)
	The system MUST provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for both students and administrators.
	The student-facing UI MUST allow students to sign in and out by entering a valid 9-digit student ID.
	The admin-facing UI MUST enable authorized administrators to view and manage user access.
	The admin interface MUST allow admins to activate, suspend, and reactivate student IDs with visual feedback.
	The admin UI MUST provide functionality to view the entire history of sign-ins and sign-outs, with filtering options based on date, time, and student ID.
	The GUI SHOULD provide clear, user-friendly error messages when a user tries to sign in with an invalid or suspended ID.

Access Control
	The system MUST require students to input their 9-digit student ID to log their sign-ins and sign-outs.
	The system MUST ensure that only activated users are allowed to sign in/out.
	The system MUST allow only authorized administrators to access the management features of the application.
	The system MUST log each access attempt, recording the student ID, sign-in time, and sign-out time.
	If a student ID is suspended, the system MUST prevent that user from signing in and display a notification indicating the suspension.

Admin Functionality
	The system MUST allow authorized admins to activate new student IDs and add first and last names associated with those IDs.
	The system MUST allow authorized admins to suspend or reactivate existing users, with real-time updates to the studentâ€™s status.
	The admin panel MUST provide filtering options to browse access logs by student ID, date range, and time range.
	The admin panel MUST display the status of each user (e.g., active, suspended) and provide actions to modify the status.

Data Validation
	The system MUST validate that the student ID entered for sign-in/sign-out is exactly 9 digits long.
	The system MUST reject sign-in or sign-out attempts with invalid, missing, or suspended student IDs, providing clear error messages.
	The system MUST prevent duplication of records during sign-ins and sign-outs by ensuring that users cannot sign in or out multiple times without completing a full cycle.

Future Extensibility
	The system SHOULD be designed to accommodate additional user types in the future (e.g., faculty members, staff, and janitors).
	The system SHALL be extensible to allow additional access control features, such as adding support for card readers or biometric authentication in the future.
	The system SHALL allow for future modifications to integrate more detailed user profiles or additional user roles.

Security
	The system MUST restrict admin features, such as activating, suspending, or reactivating users, to only authorized personnel with admin login credentials.
	The system MUST store admin credentials securely and validate login attempts before granting access to the admin panel.
	The system MUST protect student data and ensure it cannot be tampered with or altered without proper authorization.
